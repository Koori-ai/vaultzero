ACME CORPORATION
NETWORK ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
Technical Documentation - January 2026

DOCUMENT PURPOSE
This document provides a comprehensive overview of ACME Corporation's network architecture, including cloud infrastructure, connectivity, security controls, and planned improvements. This documentation supports our ongoing Zero Trust transformation initiative.

1. HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

ACME operates a cloud-first architecture primarily hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Our infrastructure spans multiple AWS regions with the following distribution:

Primary Region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
- Production workloads: 100% of customer-facing applications
- Production databases: PostgreSQL RDS instances, Redis ElastiCache
- Application servers: Auto-scaling EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers
- Storage: S3 buckets for customer files, CloudFront CDN for content delivery

Disaster Recovery Region: us-west-2 (Oregon)
- Standby RDS replicas (cross-region read replicas)
- Backup S3 buckets with cross-region replication
- Dormant infrastructure ready for failover (can be activated within 4 hours)

2. NETWORK TOPOLOGY

2.1 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Structure

Production VPC (10.0.0.0/16):
- Public Subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24): Application Load Balancers, NAT Gateways
- Private Subnets (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24): Application servers (EC2 instances)
- Database Subnets (10.0.20.0/24, 10.0.21.0/24): RDS instances, ElastiCache clusters
- Management Subnet (10.0.100.0/24): Bastion hosts, monitoring servers

Development/Staging VPC (10.1.0.0/16):
- Similar subnet structure to Production
- Separate VPC with VPC peering to Production for limited access
- Development databases populated with anonymized customer data

Corporate Office Network (172.16.0.0/16):
- Small on-premises network for 50 office employees
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to Production VPC
- Primary office in San Francisco, secondary office in Austin

2.2 Internet Connectivity

Public-Facing Services:
- Customer web application accessible via CloudFront CDN
- API endpoints via API Gateway
- Customer documentation site (static website on S3)

Outbound Internet Access:
- Application servers access internet via NAT Gateways in public subnets
- Outbound traffic not filtered or inspected (no egress filtering)
- No web proxy or secure web gateway deployed

2.3 Network Segmentation

Current Segmentation Approach:
- VPC-level isolation between Production and Dev/Staging environments
- Security groups provide instance-level firewalling
- Network ACLs (NACLs) configured at subnet level but mostly permissive
- No micro-segmentation within Production VPC
- Application tier can directly communicate with database tier without restrictions

Security Group Configuration:
- Web tier: Allows inbound 443 from internet (via ALB), outbound to app tier
- App tier: Allows inbound from web tier and management subnet, outbound to database tier and internet
- Database tier: Allows inbound from app tier on database ports, outbound to internet for patches
- Management subnet: Allows inbound SSH/RDP from corporate VPN, outbound to all subnets

Gaps in Segmentation:
- Application servers can communicate laterally without restriction
- Database servers accessible from all application servers (no per-application isolation)
- No inspection of east-west traffic between subnets
- Overly permissive security group rules in some cases (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for some outbound rules)

3. REMOTE ACCESS

3.1 VPN Infrastructure

Corporate VPN:
- Cisco AnyConnect SSL VPN
- Deployed on EC2 instances in management subnet
- Capacity: 200 concurrent connections
- Current utilization: 80-120 concurrent users (60% remote workforce)
- Authentication: Active Directory credentials + certificate (no MFA currently)
- Split tunneling enabled (only corporate network traffic routed through VPN)

Site-to-Site VPN:
- AWS Virtual Private Gateway connecting corporate office to Production VPC
- IPsec tunnel with BGP routing
- Backup connection via redundant tunnel
- Bandwidth: 100 Mbps per tunnel

3.2 Bastion Hosts

Management Access:
- Two bastion hosts in management subnet for SSH/RDP access to internal systems
- Bastion hosts accessible only via VPN
- Session logging enabled via CloudWatch
- SSH key management is manual (keys distributed via shared folder)
- No privileged access management (PAM) solution
- No just-in-time access - engineers have persistent access

Security Concerns:
- Bastion hosts represent single point of access control failure
- No session recording or playback capability
- SSH keys not rotated regularly
- No zero-trust network access (ZTNA) alternative

4. NETWORK SECURITY CONTROLS

4.1 Perimeter Security

AWS Network Firewall: NOT DEPLOYED
- Currently relying on security groups and NACLs only
- No network-level threat detection
- No intrusion prevention system (IPS)

Web Application Firewall (WAF):
- AWS WAF deployed on CloudFront distribution only
- Protects customer-facing website
- Basic ruleset: SQL injection, XSS, rate limiting
- Custom rules for blocking known bad IPs
- NOT deployed on internal Application Load Balancers
- API Gateway does not have WAF protection

DDoS Protection:
- AWS Shield Standard (default protection)
- AWS Shield Advanced NOT subscribed
- CloudFront provides some DDoS mitigation for customer website
- Application layer DDoS attacks rely on WAF rate limiting only

4.2 Traffic Inspection

Current State:
- VPC Flow Logs enabled for Production VPC
- Flow logs sent to CloudWatch Logs
- Flow logs retained for 30 days
- Flow logs NOT actively analyzed (no automated anomaly detection)
- No network traffic analysis (NTA) solution

Visibility Gaps:
- No deep packet inspection
- Cannot detect lateral movement within VPC
- Limited visibility into encrypted traffic
- No network behavioral analytics

4.3 DNS Security

DNS Configuration:
- Route 53 for external DNS (customer-facing domains)
- Internal DNS via AWS-provided DNS resolver
- No DNS filtering or threat intelligence integration
- No DNSSEC validation
- DNS query logging not enabled

5. LOAD BALANCING AND TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION

5.1 Application Load Balancers (ALB)

Customer Web Application:
- Internet-facing ALB in public subnets
- SSL/TLS termination at ALB (ACM certificates with auto-renewal)
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Cross-zone load balancing enabled

10. RISK ASSESSMENT

Current Network Security Risks (Prioritized):

HIGH RISK:
1. Lack of network micro-segmentation - enables lateral movement if perimeter breached
2. No MFA for VPN - weak authentication for critical access point
3. Split tunneling on VPN - allows unmonitored traffic and potential malware infection
4. Overly permissive security groups - violates least-privilege principle
5. No egress filtering - cannot prevent data exfiltration or C2 communication

MEDIUM RISK:
6. No TLS encryption for internal communications - lateral traffic not encrypted
7. Limited network visibility - cannot detect anomalous behavior or lateral movement
8. Manual SSH key management - keys not rotated, potentially shared
9. No ZTNA - reliance on VPN as single access control mechanism
10. GuardDuty findings not actively monitored - delayed threat response

LOW RISK:
11. Network diagrams out of date - documentation lag
12. No DNSSEC - potential DNS spoofing (mitigated by TLS at application layer)
13. Limited DDoS protection - Shield Standard only (acceptable for current scale)

11. NETWORK PERFORMANCE METRICS

Current Performance (Q4 2025 Average):
- Application response time: 250ms (95th percentile)
- Database query latency: 15ms (average)
- VPN latency: 45ms (average)
- Inter-region replication lag: 2 seconds (average)
- ALB healthy target count: 99.7% availability

Network Capacity:
- Peak bandwidth utilization: 2.5 Gbps (NAT Gateway capacity: 45 Gbps)
- VPN concurrent connections: peak 120 / capacity 200 (60% utilization)
- API requests: 500 req/sec average, 2000 req/sec peak (capacity: 10,000 req/sec)

CONCLUSION

ACME's network architecture is cloud-native and scalable, but security controls lag behind best practices for Zero Trust. The network is built on sound AWS foundations but lacks micro-segmentation, advanced threat detection, and zero-trust access controls.

Our 12-month roadmap prioritizes high-risk gaps including micro-segmentation, ZTNA deployment, and enhanced monitoring. These improvements will significantly strengthen our security posture and align with Zero Trust principles.
