CONCLUSION

ACME Corporation has foundational security controls in place but significant gaps exist across all Zero Trust pillars. The most critical gaps are:

1. Lack of EDR (endpoint detection and response)
2. No SIEM (security information and event management)
3. MFA not universally enforced
4. Limited automation and orchestration
5. No micro-segmentation

Addressing these gaps over the next 6 months will significantly improve our security posture and reduce risk of data breach. The proposed roadmap is aggressive but achievable with appropriate budget allocation and dedicated resources.

Current maturity places ACME at approximately 40th percentile compared to similar SaaS companies. With successful execution of the improvement roadmap, we expect to reach 70th-75th percentile within 12 months.
