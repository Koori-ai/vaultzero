ACME CORPORATION
INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
Version 2.1 - January 2026

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines ACME Corporation's information security policies and procedures. ACME is a mid-sized SaaS company providing cloud-based project management solutions to enterprise customers. We process sensitive business data for approximately 15,000 active users across 500 customer organizations.

Our security program is currently transitioning from a traditional perimeter-based model to a Zero Trust architecture. This policy reflects our current state and planned improvements over the next 12 months.

1. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT

1.1 User Authentication
- All employees must authenticate using Active Directory credentials
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is deployed for major applications including Office 365, Salesforce, and our internal project management system
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is REQUIRED for VPN access
- MFA is OPTIONAL for other applications (currently 40% adoption rate)
- Password requirements: Minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements enabled, 90-day rotation policy

1.2 Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is partially implemented across core systems
- Access reviews are conducted annually by department managers
- New employee access provisioning takes 2-3 business days through IT helpdesk tickets
- Termination access revocation process exists but sometimes delayed up to 24 hours
- Privileged access is granted through domain admin accounts (no separate PAM solution)

1.3 Known Gaps
- No automated user provisioning/deprovisioning
- Service accounts use static passwords stored in Excel spreadsheet
- No identity governance platform
- Local admin rights prevalent on developer workstations
- No just-in-time access for elevated permissions

2. DEVICE SECURITY

2.1 Endpoint Management
- Corporate-issued laptops: 80% of workforce
- BYOD policy exists for mobile devices
- Windows devices managed via basic Group Policy (no modern MDM)
- MacOS devices have limited management (no Jamf or similar)
- Traditional antivirus (Windows Defender) on all corporate PCs
- NO endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution deployed

2.2 Patch Management
- Windows patches deployed monthly via WSUS
- Patching cycle typically 2-3 weeks after Microsoft release
- Critical patches expedited but still take 7-10 days
- Third-party application patching is manual and inconsistent
- Developer machines often exempt from automatic patching

2.3 Device Compliance
- No device health attestation before network access
- USB ports not restricted
- Full disk encryption required on laptops but not enforced technically
- Mobile devices (BYOD) not enrolled in any management platform
- No remote wipe capability for personal devices

2.4 Known Gaps
- No EDR or advanced threat protection
- Device inventory tracked manually in spreadsheet
- No automated compliance checking
- Personal devices accessing corporate email without security controls

3. NETWORK SECURITY

3.1 Network Architecture
- Primary datacenter in AWS us-east-1 with disaster recovery in us-west-2
- Traditional VPN (Cisco AnyConnect) for remote access
- VPN uses split-tunneling (not all traffic routed through corporate network)
- Perimeter firewall protecting cloud infrastructure
- Internal AWS network is relatively flat with basic security groups

3.2 Network Segmentation
- Production environment separated from development/staging via VPCs
- No micro-segmentation within production environment
- Database tier accessible from multiple application servers
- Limited east-west traffic inspection
- Guest WiFi (for on-site contractors) uses separate VLAN but shares internet gateway

3.3 Remote Access
- VPN required for access to internal systems
- VPN uses certificate-based authentication plus AD credentials
- NO zero-trust network access (ZTNA) solution
- Split tunneling allows users to bypass corporate security controls
- No continuous authentication or trust verification

3.4 Network Monitoring
- Basic AWS CloudWatch monitoring enabled
- VPC Flow Logs collected but not actively analyzed
- No network behavioral analytics
- IDS/IPS rules outdated (last updated 18 months ago)
- Security events generate alerts but response time varies (4-48 hours)

3.5 Known Gaps

- Limited visibility into east-west traffic
- No automated threat response
- VPN as single point of access control

4. APPLICATION SECURITY

4.2 Application Access
- Customer-facing web application uses modern authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- Internal applications have inconsistent authentication mechanisms
- Some legacy systems use shared accounts
- API security exists but not comprehensive (basic API keys, no rate limiting)

- Incident response playbooks exist but not regularly tested

4.4 Known Gaps
- DevSecOps practices not fully implemented

5. DATA SECURITY

5.1 Data Classification
- Data classification policy exists but not widely implemented
- Customer data marked as "Confidential" in some systems
- No automated data discovery or classification tools
- Data classification training provided during onboarding only

5.2 Data Protection
- Database encryption at rest enabled for production databases (AWS RDS encryption)
- File storage (S3) does not use encryption at rest consistently
- TLS 1.2+ enforced for data in transit for customer-facing applications
- Internal API communications sometimes use HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Email encryption available (S/MIME) but not enforced

5.3 Data Loss Prevention
- Basic DLP rules configured in Office 365 for credit card numbers and SSN
- DLP not implemented for file shares or endpoint devices
- Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) not deployed
- Data exfiltration monitoring limited to email gateway

5.4 Data Backup and Recovery

- MFA adoption rate
- Security awareness training completion rate
- Number of critical/high vulnerabilities detected and remediated
- Failed login attempts and potential account compromises

Current Performance (Q4 2025):
- MTTD: 8 hours (target: <2 hours)
- MTTR: 18 hours (target: <4 hours)
- Patch compliance: 82% (target: 95%)
- MFA adoption: 45% (target: 100%)
- Security training completion: 94% (target: 100%)

CONCLUSION

ACME Corporation's security program is in transition from a traditional perimeter-based approach to a modern Zero Trust architecture. While we have strong foundational controls in place, significant gaps exist in identity governance, endpoint protection, network segmentation, and security automation.

Our planned 12-month roadmap addresses these gaps systematically, with a focus on high-impact improvements in the first 6 months. Investment in modern security tools and processes will position ACME to better protect our customers' data and maintain our security certifications.

This policy will be reviewed and updated quarterly as we progress through our security transformation journey.
